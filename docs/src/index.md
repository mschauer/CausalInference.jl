# CausalInference.jl

A Julia package for causal inference, graphical models and structure learning with the PC and FCI algorithms. This package contains for now the stable PC algorithm [`pcalg`](@ref) as well as the extended FCI algorithm. 

## Introduction

The aim of this package is to provide Julia implementations of two popular algorithms for causal structure identification, the PC algorithm and the FCI algorithm. The aim of these algorithms is to identify causal relationships in observational data alone, in circumstances where running experiments or A/B tests is impractical or even impossible. While identification of all causal relationships in observational data is not always possible, both algorithms clearly indicate which causal can and which cannot be determined from observational data.

Causal inference is by no means an easy subject. Readers without any prior exposure to these topics are encouraged to go over the following resources in order to get a basic idea of what's involved in causal inference:

- [On Pearlâ€™s Hierarchy and the Foundations of Causal Inference](https://causalai.net/r60.pdf)

There are also tutorials and examples linked in the navigation bar of this package.

## Implementation Details

The PC algorithm was tested on random DAGs by comparing the result of the PC algorithm using the *d*-separation oracle with the CPDAG computed with Chickering's DAG->CPDAG conversion algorithm (implemented as [`dsep`](@ref) and [`cpdag`](@ref) in this package).

See the [Library](https://mschauer.github.io/CausalInference.jl/latest/library/) for other implemented functionality.

The algorithms use the `SimpleGraph` and `SimpleDiGraph` graph representation of the Julia package [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl).
Both types of graphs are represented by sorted adjacency lists (vectors of vectors in the LightGraphs implementation).

CPDAGs are just modeled as `SimpleDiGraph`s, where unoriented edges are represented by a forward and a backward directed edge.

## Performance

The speed of the algorithm is comparable with the C++ code of the R package `pcalg` after some pending optimisations.
